Codebase for my Screeps (Scripting Creeps) bot: https://screeps.com

Not very complicated yet.  My core concept revolves around stationary harvesters, with dedicated haulers, builders, and upgraders.  Builders and upgraders share the same body type, though, so I'd like to be able to combine them somehow eventually.

I have a quota handler function that I still need to merge in from my live codebase, to set quotas for various creep types based on the characteristics of a given room, but it's a WIP (like all of this).
